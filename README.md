# ✨ LinkedIn Post Generator

This project is a **LinkedIn Post Generator** application that uses an LLM to generate posts based on a selected LinkedIn creator’s style, specific topic, and post length. This app is built using **Streamlit** and allows users to generate LinkedIn posts that align with the style of popular content creators.
